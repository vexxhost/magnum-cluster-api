# Introduction

The Cluster API driver for Magnum enables OpenStack Magnum, a container
orchestration service, to create and manage Kubernetes clusters using the
Cluster API framework. The Cluster API driver for Magnum leverages the power of
the Cluster API to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters
within an OpenStack infrastructure.

With the Cluster API driver for Magnum, Magnum takes on the responsibility of
creating and maintaining the Cluster API resources. Magnum interacts with the
Cluster API controllers and reconcilers to dynamically provision and manage
Kubernetes clusters.

Magnum utilizes the capabilities of the Cluster API to define the desired state
of the Kubernetes clusters using familiar Cluster API resources such as `Cluster`,
`MachineDeployment`, and `MachineSet`. These resources encapsulate important
cluster configurations, including the number of control plane and worker nodes,
their specifications, and other relevant attributes.

By leveraging the Cluster API driver for Magnum, Magnum translates the desired
cluster specifications into Cluster API resources. It creates and manages these
resources, ensuring that the Kubernetes clusters are provisioned and maintained
according to the specified configurations.

Through this integration, Magnum empowers users to leverage the Cluster API's
declarative and consistent approach to manage their Kubernetes clusters in an
OpenStack environment. By leveraging Magnum's container orchestration
capabilities, users can easily create and scale Kubernetes deployments while
benefiting from the automation and extensibility provided by the Cluster API.
